# TTS mode (text-to-speech)

Fourth reader mode alongside RSVP / scroll / ereader. The engine drives the
narration through a TTS backend; the scroll view's existing highlight pill
tracks the spoken word so users see what they hear.

```

Backend selection happens in `ttsBackendProvider`
(`lib/features/rsvp_reader/presentation/providers/tts_backend_provider.dart`):
- Linux → `SpeechdSocketBackend` (when the socket isn't up yet, `init()`
  runs `speech-dispatcher --spawn` and polls briefly for it to appear)
- Everywhere else → `FlutterTtsBackend`

`TtsPlayer` is the new orchestration layer. It owns a small queue of
pre-extracted `SentenceSegment`s and uses `TtsQueueMode.add` so the
backend (which on Android/iOS forwards to `flutter_tts.setQueueMode(1)`,
and on Linux forwards to a single open daemon connection) stitches
chunks together with no audible gap. Without this, every chunk
boundary cost ~200–500ms of IPC + engine start-up.

## Engine integration

`RsvpEngineNotifier` keeps the RSVP path (Ticker-driven) and the TTS path
in the same notifier so reading sessions, progress saves, and the
end-of-book `finishTicket` semantics fire uniformly. TTS-specific
playback is delegated to `TtsPlayer`; the engine only manages state
transitions, session bookkeeping, and audio-handler binding.

Key methods:

- `enterTtsMode()` — flushes any in-flight RSVP session, lazy-constructs
  the player, calls `player.init()`, pushes content + settings, fires
  `player.applySettings()` so the backend is ready for previews. Doesn't
  play. Also binds the engine to the lockscreen `TtsAudioHandler` so
  background controls show up.
- `play()` — branches on `state.mode`. In TTS mode it asks the player to
  play from `state.globalWordIndex`. The "already at the last word"
  guard from the RSVP path is *not* applied — the player's
  `onBookFinished` callback handles end-of-book.
- `pause()` — in TTS mode it calls `player.pause()`, keeps `mode == tts`
  (so the UI stays on the scroll-with-highlight view), and runs the
  same `_flushSession()` + `_saveProgress()` that the RSVP path uses.
- `seekToWord()` — forwards to `player.seek(globalIndex)`. The player
  drains its queue and rebuilds the pipeline from the new position.
- Player callbacks (`onWordAdvance`, `onBookFinished`, `onError`) drive
  the engine state and session counters.

### TtsPlayer pipeline

The player keeps a fixed lookahead of 2 segments and pushes them onto
the backend with `TtsQueueMode.add`. While segment N plays, segment
N+1 is already queued — the platform engine plays them back to back
with no audible gap. Both backends queue natively: `flutter_tts` via
`setQueueMode(1)`, `SpeechdSocketBackend` via the daemon.

Race safety: a `_generation` counter is bumped on every action that
should invalidate in-flight callbacks (`pause`, `seek`, `dispose`).
Each queued segment stores the generation in which it was enqueued;
stale progress / completion callbacks compare against the live counter
and bail. `_isPlaying` is set to `true` synchronously *before* any
`await` so a `pause()` issued in the same tick (typical when the user
taps pause right after play) actually stops the backend.

Settings dedup: the player tracks `_appliedEngineId` / `_appliedLanguage`
/ `_appliedVoiceName` / `_appliedPitch` / `_appliedRate` per-field, so
a slider that re-emits the same value (or `applySettings()` called
back-to-back during init + first speak) doesn't burn IPC re-pushing
unchanged settings. Each field advances *after* its individual `await`
succeeds, so a half-applied snapshot (when `pause` cancels mid-stream)
still leaves the backend coherent on the next push.

Stall detection: every `onProgress` callback updates `_lastProgressAt`.
`restartIfStalled()` (called from the screen's
`didChangeAppLifecycleState(resumed)`) fires a full restart only when
the last heartbeat is older than `_stallThreshold` (10s). A null
heartbeat (paused or never started) is treated as healthy — no
spurious restarts when the user just opened the reader.

## Sentence extraction

`extractSentenceFrom(chapters, startGlobalIndex)`
(`domain/utils/sentence_extractor.dart`) walks tokens linearly and stops
on:

1. A speakable token ending with `.`, `!`, `?`, or `…` (terminator
   included in the segment).
2. The next token starting a new chapter (the chapter title's first word
   belongs to the *next* segment so the pause lands at the seam).
3. A safety cap (`kSentenceMaxTokens = 80`) — protects against bullet
   lists without terminal punctuation.

Image tokens are part of the range (`endGlobalIndexExcl` includes them)
but never enter the spoken string. The highlight skips silently.

## Speech rate

TTS uses an independent audiobook-style rate scale rather than mapping
the user's RSVP WPM target onto a synth rate. The two never converted
intuitively — WPM is fundamentally an RSVP concept (a deterministic
frame interval), while TTS rate scales the synth's natural cadence,
which varies by voice. Users intuit "1.0x / 1.25x / 1.5x" instantly;
"300 WPM" was an awkward translation.

```
rate = DisplaySettings.ttsRate, clamped to [0.5, 3.0]
```

The engine forwards this directly to `TtsBackend.setRate(rate)` on every
`speak()` call. Backends translate to native units:

- `flutter_tts.setSpeechRate(rate * 0.5)` — the plugin's scale treats
  **0.5 as normal speed** (Android multiplies by 2 before
  `TextToSpeech.setSpeechRate`; iOS maps 0.5 to
  `AVSpeechUtteranceDefaultSpeechRate`), so `flutterTtsRate()` halves our
  audiobook value and clamps to the plugin band `[0.1, 1.5]`. Passing the
  audiobook value through unconverted made every Android install speak at
  2× — don't "simplify" the conversion away.
- `SET SELF RATE <int>` (SSIP) — `((rate - 1.0) * 50).clamp(-100, +100)`.

The transport row reuses the `WpmCapsule` in TTS mode with a rate label
(`formatTtsRate`) so the speed control always shows the appropriate
scale. Preset chips: `0.5 / 0.75 / 1.0 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2.0 / 2.5
/ 3.0`. The capsule step (+/- 25 WPM) becomes 0.25x for the rate.

`setWpm` does **not** propagate to the TTS backend — only `setTtsRate`
does. Switching modes preserves both settings independently.

## Linux backend (`SpeechdSocketBackend`)

Talks SSIP over the persistent Unix socket that `speech-dispatcher`
(default on almost every Linux desktop distro) exposes at
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/speech-dispatcher/speechd.sock`. One connection is
opened in `init()` and reused for every command; the daemon queues
utterances, so pipelined segments play gap-free.

### Autospawn

When the socket is absent (daemon not yet started), `init()` runs
`speech-dispatcher --spawn` and polls briefly (50→200 ms) for the socket
to appear — the same implicit start `spd-say` used to do. If the daemon
never comes up, `init()` throws `TtsUnavailableException` and the reader
surfaces a localised snackbar pointing the user to
`sudo apt install speech-dispatcher` (or the distro equivalent).

### Emulated word boundaries

SSIP's `INDEX_MARK` events only fire for explicitly marked text, so word
boundaries are approximated with a periodic timer started on the `701
BEGIN` event and stopped on `702 END`, at the cadence implied by the
configured rate. Drift accumulates ±200 ms across long sentences —
acceptable for a visual highlight; audible side-by-side comparison shows
reasonable sync.

## UI summary

| Surface | Widget | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mode switcher | `ReaderModeFab` | Floating pill in the bottom-left of the reading area that expands into three labelled options (RSVP / E-reader / TTS). Hidden during playback and while scrolling down. `ReaderMode.scroll` collapses under "RSVP" since it's just the paused state of the RSVP reading experience. |
| Mode area in TTS | `ContextScrollView(showHighlight: true)` | Same surface used by `ReaderMode.scroll`; the engine's progress callback drives the highlight. |
| Transport row | `RsvpControls` | `ControlsTransportRow` takes a `speedControl` widget; the parent feeds the `WpmCapsule` a WPM or TTS-rate label based on `state.mode`. |
| Settings sheet | `DisplaySettingsPanel._buildTtsSection` | Voice picker (opens `TtsVoicePickerSheet`) and pitch slider. (The rate lives in the transport row, not here — same as the WPM selector.) |
| Voice picker | `TtsVoicePickerSheet` | `DraggableScrollableSheet` listing voices grouped by locale; each row has a preview button that speaks `ttsVoicePreviewSample` through the backend without committing. |

## Persistence and sync

Four new fields on `DisplaySettings`:

- `ttsLanguage` (`String`, default `'en-US'`)
- `ttsVoiceName` (`String?`, default `null` — falls back to first voice
  of the locale)
- `ttsPitch` (`double`, default `1.0`)
- `ttsRate` (`double`, default `1.0`, range `[0.5, 3.0]`)

All four persist to `SharedPreferences` via `DisplaySettingsNotifier`
and propagate through Drive sync via the existing
`displaySettingsToMap` / `displaySettingsFromMap` in
`LibrarySyncService`. When a synced `ttsVoiceName` doesn't exist on the
local device, the engine falls back to the locale's default voice but
preserves the name in storage so a round-trip to the original device
restores it.

## Reading sessions

TTS sessions log to `reading_session` exactly like RSVP sessions —
`_sessionStartedAt`, `_sessionStartWordIndex`, and `_wordsInSession` are
the same fields, and the threshold filters
(`computeSessionAvgWpm` requires ≥ 5 words and ≥ 3 s) apply uniformly.
The stats dashboard, monthly recap, and book completion screens pick
them up automatically.

## Background playback

`audio_service` hosts the TTS playback in a foreground service on
Android and in an `AVAudioSession(category=playback)` on iOS so the OS
doesn't kill the synthesiser when the user backgrounds the app. The
notification + lockscreen controls (rewind / play-pause / fastForward)
are driven by `TtsAudioHandler`:

- `main.dart` calls `AudioService.init(builder: TtsAudioHandler.new, …)`
  on platforms that report `PlatformCapabilities.supportsBackgroundAudio`
  (everywhere except Linux + Web). The result is injected via the
  Riverpod override `ttsAudioHandlerProvider`.
- `RsvpEngineNotifier._bindAudioHandler` registers a callback bundle
  (`TtsAudioSource`) on `enterTtsMode`, calls `setActiveBook` with the
  book title / author for the notification, and pushes
  `updatePlaybackState(playing: …)` on every play/pause/error/finish.
- The handler forwards play/pause/skip from the OS controls back to
  those same callbacks, so headphone clicks, bluetooth play/pause, and
  the lockscreen UI all drive the actual engine.
- `MainActivity` extends `AudioServiceActivity` (not plain
  `FlutterActivity`) so `MEDIA_BUTTON` intents reach the plugin. The
  manifest declares `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`,
  the `AudioService` service, and the `MediaButtonReceiver`.
- iOS adds `UIBackgroundModes: audio` in `Info.plist`. The flutter_tts
  backend also calls `setIosAudioCategory(playback, …, spokenAudio)`
  during `init()` so the audio routes correctly through the shared
  AVAudioSession.

Linux and Web don't run the audio handler — the engine still works on
those platforms but TTS pauses when the OS suspends the app.

## TTS engine picker

`TtsBackend.getEngines()` lists every alternative engine the backend
knows about; `setEngine(id)` switches which one new utterances use:

- **Android**: `flutter_tts.getEngines` enumerates installed
  `TTS_SERVICE` providers (Google TTS, Samsung TTS, Pico, …).
- **Linux**: `LIST OUTPUT_MODULES` via the SSIP socket — these are
  speech-dispatcher's output modules (`espeak-ng`, `festival`, `flite`,
  `rhvoice`).
- **iOS / macOS / Windows / Web**: returns an empty list — the OS
  bundles a single synthesiser.

UI:
- `TtsEnginePickerSheet` lists engines + a "System default" option.
  Selecting commits to `DisplaySettings.ttsEngineId` and the engine
  applies it on the next utterance.
- The row is hidden when the backend reports ≤1 engine, so iOS users
  don't see an empty picker.

`ttsEngineId` syncs through Drive like the other TTS settings; the
backend ignores an unknown id (falls back to the system default)
without losing the stored value, so a round-trip to the original
device restores it.

### Engine switching is serialised inside `FlutterTtsBackend`

`flutter_tts`'s Android side keeps a **single** pending `Result` slot for
`setEngine` and drains queued method calls against a half-initialised
client when two `setEngine`s overlap — one caller's `await` hangs
forever, the other gets its `Result` answered prematurely, and the
plugin's own `onInit` then clobbers language/voice with the new engine's
defaults. It also never stops/shuts down the outgoing native client, so
audio from the old engine plays over the new one and its late completion
callbacks pop the `TtsPlayer` queue.

`FlutterTtsBackend` defends against all of this without forking the
plugin: every operation goes through an internal serialising queue
(`_enqueue`), `setEngine` dedups by the currently-active id, calls
`stop()` on the outgoing client first, and wraps the plugin call in an
8 s timeout so a wedged engine init can't freeze the player. This is why
`ttsVoicesProvider` can safely call `setEngine` before listing voices
while the player applies settings concurrently.

Settings flow: the picker sheets write only to the global
`displaySettingsProvider` (they have no bookId); `RsvpEngineNotifier`
mirrors the provider into its own snapshot via a constructor-time
`ref.listen` (preserving the per-book WPM), so the player sees fresh
engine/voice on the next play without reopening the book.

## Limitations and follow-ups

- **Sentence-level skip controls** are out of scope; the existing
  10-word skip buttons remain the only fast-skip primitive.
- **Multi-byte text** (CJK, emoji) may drift on Android because
  `flutter_tts` reports `charOffset` in UTF-16 code units while iOS uses
  characters. For latin scripts the two coincide; if multi-byte support
  becomes a need, normalise in `_onProgress`.
- **Linux pause/resume** does not preserve mid-sentence position —
  speech-dispatcher's `CANCEL` drops the current utterance. The player
  re-speaks the current sentence from `globalWordIndex` on resume.
- **SSML index marks on Linux**: word-boundary callbacks are still
  timer-emulated. Future work: insert `<mark name="wN"/>` between
  tokens and listen for `703 INDEX_MARK` events for true accuracy.
- **Word-level highlight is effectively Google-TTS-only on Android.**
  The highlight depends on the engine emitting
  `UtteranceProgressListener.onRangeStart`, which is optional — an
  engine only fires it if its synthesis pipeline calls
  `SynthesisCallback.rangeStart`. The stock Google TTS engine does;
  most third-party engines (SherpaTTS included) don't. On those, the
  highlight only advances at sentence completions. Verified on-device
  2026-07-07: Google TTS highlights per word, SherpaTTS per sentence.
  There's no capability query for this; a future improvement could
  fall back to a timer-estimated highlight (like the Linux backend)
  when no `onRangeStart` arrives within the first utterance.
- **SherpaTTS (Android, `org.woheller69.ttsengine`)** — structural
  limits of that engine, not bugs on our side: no `rangeStart` (see
  above); it exposes no named voices (selection is per downloaded
  language model — `setVoice` is a silent no-op there); it ignores the
  system/app speech rate unless its own "apply system speed" toggle is
  on (our rate slider does nothing otherwise); and its neural synthesis
  is blocking, so utterances start with a noticeable delay (seconds on
  a cold start while the model loads). Verdict from manual testing:
  usable but not the default recommendation — the stock Google engine
  with a well-chosen voice is the better experience.
